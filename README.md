# llamar.cpp

`llamar.cpp` is a research extension of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) implementing **inference-time latent recurrence**: a designated layer interval $[L_{\text{lo}} \dots L_{\text{hi}}]$ is re-applied $T$ times per token inside the forward pass, instead of spending more output tokens on a chain-of-thought scratchpad.

The implementation adds no weight parameters, requires no fine-tuning, and is off by default: at `recurrent_t = 1` `build_recurrent_core()` takes the plain single-pass path and builds the same graph upstream builds. **Status: experimental.** Modes 1-4 below change the deliberation update and carry no measured quality claim in this repository; see [Measurement status](#measurement-status).

## Architectural Core

### 1. KV Cache Isolation Engine (`store_kv = false`)

In standard Transformer autoregressive decoding, each attention layer writes Key and Value projections into the KV cache at the current token offset. In un-isolated recurrent passes, evaluating layer $L$ multiple times causes secondary and tertiary passes to overwrite or pollute the KV cache with transient latent representations. This causes catastrophic syntactic degradation in downstream tokens, breaking complex nested state machines (e.g. AST evaluators, recursive parsers, diff engines).

`llamar.cpp` solves this through strict hardware-level KV cache isolation:

```
Token t:
├── Prelude [0 .. lo-1]:
│   └── Forward pass straight through -> produces anchor_e
├── Pass 0 (Pristine Baseline, t = 0):
│   └── Core [lo .. hi] with store_kv = true
│       └── Writes pristine K_0, V_0 to autoregressive KV cache
│       └── Computes baseline representation h^(0) and delta_0 = h^(0) - anchor_e
├── Deliberation Passes (t = 1 .. T-1):
│   └── Core [lo .. hi] with store_kv = false
│       └── Attends to full history + pristine K_0, V_0 WITHOUT modifying cache
│       └── Computes raw candidate delta_t = Decoder(h^(t-1)) - h^(t-1)
│       └── Dispatches delta_t to the recurrence mode (0 vanilla / 1 orsd / 2 snc / 3 cav / 4 dscc)
│       └── Updates h^(t) = h^(t-1) + gamma * delta_deliberation
└── Coda [hi+1 .. n_layer-1]:
    └── Forward pass straight through from h^(T-1) to final logits
```

- **Pass 0 ($t=0$, `store_kv = true`)**: Computes nominal forward pass representations and commits pristine $K_0, V_0$ vectors to the KV cache for the current token position.
- **Passes $t \ge 1$ (`store_kv = false`)**: Deliberation passes execute self-attention reading from the KV cache, but **never write to it**. Because pass 0 is the only writer for the token, downstream tokens see exactly the history a single-pass forward pass would have left.

The only per-token cost of a deliberation pass is the read bandwidth of the attention it performs against the existing cache; no additional cache cells are allocated.

---

### 2. Recurrence modes (mode 1 = ORSD-Core)

Each deliberation pass $t \ge 1$ produces a block difference $\Delta_t = \text{Decoder}(h_t) - h_t$, and the state is updated as $h_{t+1} = h_t + \gamma\,\Delta^{\text{used}}_t$ with $\gamma$ = `--recurrent-gate`. The modes differ only in how $\Delta^{\text{used}}_t$ is derived from $\Delta_t$.

**Mode 1 (ORSD)** removes the directions the previous passes already used, then resets the magnitude. With $u_0 = \Delta_0$ and $u_j$ the already-projected difference of pass $j$:

$$\Delta_t^\perp = \Delta_t - \sum_{j < t} \frac{\langle \Delta_t, u_j \rangle}{\max(\langle u_j, u_j \rangle, 10^{-7})} u_j \qquad
\Delta^{\text{used}}_t = \mathrm{RMSNorm}(\Delta_t^\perp) \cdot \mathrm{RMS}(\Delta_0)$$

`RMSNorm` here is `ggml_rms_norm` (plain RMS, no learned weight), so the applied update always has per-token RMS equal to $\mathrm{RMS}(\Delta_0)$ regardless of the real block difference: the magnitude of the update is set by pass 0, not by the layer. Once $\mathrm{span}\{u_0 \dots u_{t-1}\}$ fills $\mathbb{R}^{n_{\text{embd}}}$, the residual is numerical noise and the update decays toward zero — it cannot grow without bound, because `ggml_rms_norm` bounds its gain by $1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$.

Modes 2, 3 and 4 are described in the mode table. All of them discard the true magnitude of the block difference as well; the only external scale knob is `--recurrent-gate`.

---

### 3. Recurrence modes

All formulas are per token. $\gamma$ is `--recurrent-gate`, default `1.0`.

| Mode | Name | What the code computes | Known property |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | `vanilla` | $\Delta^{\text{used}}_t = \Delta_t$ | The layer is re-applied to its own output and the difference is fed back once. Reference for every other mode. |
| **1** | `orsd` | $\Delta_t^\perp$ by Gram-Schmidt against $\mathrm{span}\{u_0 \dots u_{t-1}\}$, then $\mathrm{RMSNorm}(\Delta_t^\perp)\cdot\mathrm{RMS}(\Delta_0)$ | Update magnitude fixed by pass 0; direction loses the previous passes' span. Decays, cannot blow up. |
| **2** | `snc` | $m_t = 0.6\,m_{t-1} + 0.4\,\Delta_t$ (with $m_0 = \Delta_0$), $\Delta^{\text{used}}_t = \mathrm{RMSNorm}(m_t)$ | Unit-RMS update: the magnitude is set by $1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, not by the model. $\mu = 0.6$ is a hard-coded literal, not tunable. |
| **3** | `cav` | $g_t = \mathrm{clamp}(\cos(h_t, \text{anchor}_e), 0, 1)$, $\Delta^{\text{used}}_t = \Delta_t \cdot g_t$ | A per-token scale in $[0,1]$ on the *true* difference: it can only shrink the update, never redirect it. Evaluated on $h_t$, the state *before* this pass, so a state that drifts from the anchor switches the update off. |
| **4** | `dscc` | $v \leftarrow \mathrm{RMSNorm}(0.65\,v + 0.35\,\Delta_t)$, $\Delta^{\text{used}}_t = \Delta_t + 0.2\,(v - h_t)$ | Scale defect: $v$ is resealed to unit RMS while $h$ is the full residual stream, so $v \approx -h$ after the first pass and the update is effectively $\Delta_t - 0.2\,h_t$ — a fixed shrink of the state, not a second stream. $\alpha = 0.35$ and the `0.2` feedback are literals. |

Modes 1-4 are experimental: they change the update rule, and no measurement in this repository supports a quality claim for any of them. They are kept (with their numbers) so existing runs stay reproducible. Modes 5 (`hybrid`) and 6 (`akr`) **do not exist** — they have no branch in `build_recurrent_core()` and would silently run mode 0. Both the argument parser and `llama_context` refuse them.

---

## Configuration & CLI Options

Recurrence parameters are configured via CLI flags, environment variables, or config files:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `--recurrent-t <T>` | `1` | Passes of the core layers per token. `1` = recurrence off; `2` = one deliberation pass. |
| `--recurrent-layer <L>` | `-1` | Core layer A. `-1` resolves to `0.38 * n_layer` when `T > 1`. |
| `--recurrent-layer-b <L_b>` | `-1` | Core layer B. With B set, the core spans `[min(A,B) .. max(A,B)]` and every layer in that span runs each pass. A gap of exactly 2 additionally switches to the sandwich topology (loop over `{lo, hi}`, layer `lo+1` as bridge) unless `--recurrent-bridge` is given. |
| `--recurrent-bridge <L>` | `-1` | Layer executed once between the loop and the coda. Must be a valid layer index **strictly inside** `[lo, hi]`; anything else is refused at context creation (a bridge inside the loop range would run that layer twice and double-write its KV entries). |
| `--recurrent-mode <mode>` | `0` | `0` vanilla, `1` orsd, `2` snc, `3` cav, `4` dscc. Modes 1-4 experimental. `5`/`6` are rejected. |
| `--recurrent-gate <gamma>` | `1.0` | Scale of the applied update, `0 <= gamma <= 1`. There is no tuned value for any mode in this repository; the default is what the modes were written against. |
| `--recurrent-config <path>` | `""` | Path to a JSON or `.rlang` configuration file. |

`llama-bench` exposes only `--recurrent-t` and `--recurrent-layer`; the rest is inference-only.

### Example CLI Invocations

```sh
# 1. Nominal baseline (T=1 takes the plain single-pass path)
./build/bin/llama-cli -m model.gguf -p "Implement Tarjan's SCC algorithm"

# 2. ORSD on a two-layer core, 13<->15 sandwich with layer 14 as the bridge
./build/bin/llama-cli -m qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf \
    --recurrent-t 2 \
    --recurrent-layer 13 \
    --recurrent-layer-b 15 \
    --recurrent-mode 1 \
    -p "..."

# 3. Via configuration file
./build/bin/llama-cli -m model.gguf --recurrent-config recurrent_configs/recurrent_t2_step300.json -p "..."
```

## Measurement status

**There is currently no publishable measurement of the recurrent core in this repository, and the tables that used to claim otherwise have been removed.** This section is the reason; the machinery to fix it is described in [`benchmarks/README-BENCHMARKS.md`](benchmarks/README-BENCHMARKS.md).

What the removed tables claimed, and why each claim could not stand:

| Removed claim | Why it is not a result |
|---|---|
| `5/9 → 6/9` accuracy for ORSD vs base on a 9-task set, with latency per arm | No driver, grader, prompt or results file for this set is in the repository. A 1-task difference on 9 tasks is not distinguishable from run-to-run variance. |
| `9-task` "vanilla collapses to 22.2%" vs ORSD `66.7%` | Same, and it is the mode 0 baseline, so the two arms differ in more than the mode under test. |
| SVD audit: $\kappa = 42\,487$, $\sigma_{\max} = 17.38$, `srank 102.6/3584` | The numbers existed only as literals in a paper-builder script. No script in this repository loads Qwen2.5-Coder weights and factorises $W_{\text{down}}W_{\text{gate}}$. |
| Norm/rank table `59.87 → 241.15 → 1823.08`, rank `14.2 → 1.8` | No measuring script; the "rank" is over a 16-token window with no stated estimator, and `docs/openmythos/openmythos_results_rtx3050.md` records the same kind of configuration (the LTI variant, since removed) degrading to perplexity `1292` at `T=2` and `NaN` at `T=3`, which the table does not mention. That trace does not measure the current update rule either. |
| 13-task `7/13 (53.8%) → 11/13 (84.6%)`, "+30.8% verified silicon gain" | The delta comes from a change in generation length (`512 → 1024` tokens) plus prompt framing, not from the recurrent core — the baseline row has `T=1`. Attributing it to the feature is a confound, and the `+30.8%` is a relative figure presented as a gain. |
| "`26.2 to 34.0 t/s` at `T=2`", "minimal latency impact" | No benchmark log or harness output is stored, and the range is given without `n` or a variance. `T=2` re-runs the core layer, so the cost is strictly additive on the core; it is not a free 1.0-1.3x. |
| "solves `tarjan_scc` and `interval_tree` without hallucination" | A per-task pass is not a mechanism claim. |
| "machine-verified in Lean 4, zero unclosed `sorry`s" | `RecurrentStability.lean` proved properties of an abstract Krasnoselskii-Mann operator, not of the code in this repository. It was referenced only from this README, no CI ever built it, and it has been deleted together with the rest of the unverifiable material. |

The 52-task suite in `benchmarks/` is the closest thing to a real harness. It is also not a result yet: the reference arm contradicted itself (`passed=40 total=52` while its own categories summed to 52/66, because stored counters were incremented on top of cached verdicts), three of the four "improvement" arms claimed modes 5 and 6, which never existed, and the arms that reported a gain also ran with a looser grader and a 3x logic budget. Those files are quarantined in `benchmarks/unverified/`, the drivers now refuse a mode that does not exist, and every arm must stamp the grader revision, the per-category token budget and the model/binary/dataset hashes it ran under before its score can be cited.

To produce a real number: run `benchmarks/eval_baseline_t1.py` and `benchmarks/eval_optuna_champion.py` on the same binary in the same session, `n >= 3` per arm, and compare per-task deltas on the discordant pairs rather than the totals.

## Additional Engine Optimizations

- **MoE fused gate+up (`-fgu`).** Concatenates the MoE `gate_exps` and `up_exps` tensors during graph construction into a single `gate_up` GEMM per layer, halving the memory traffic and barrier sync of the two-projection path (`src/llama-context.cpp`).
- **MoE prefill offload.** Host pinned-memory registration (`GGML_CUDA_REGISTER_HOST=1`) and asynchronous expert prefetching (`GGML_SCHED_PREFETCH_EXPERTS=1`) reduce PCIe transfer stalls for partially-offloaded MoE models; the latter requires disabling CUDA graphs (`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1`).
- **Expert batching / token prefetching.** Weight-major dequantisation and hardware prefetching inside the expert routing loops in the CPU backend.

## Build

Builds follow upstream llama.cpp. The recurrence feature lives in the graph builder `build_recurrent_core()` (`src/llama-graph.cpp`) and needs no compile-time flag.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DGGML_CUDA=ON
make -j$(nproc) llama-cli llama-server llama-bench
```

See [docs/build.md](docs/build.md) and [docs/backend](docs/backend) for CUDA, Metal, ROCm, Vulkan, SYCL, and CPU backend options.

```

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide
range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is the main playground for developing new features for the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.

## Obtaining and quantizing models

The [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) platform hosts a [number of LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending) compatible with `llama.cpp`:

- [Trending](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending)
- [LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=llama+gguf)

You can either manually download the GGUF file or directly use any `llama.cpp`-compatible models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) or other model hosting sites, by using this CLI argument: `-hf <user>/<model>[:quant]`. For example:

```sh
llama-cli -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF
```

By default, the CLI would download from Hugging Face, you can switch to other options with the environment variable `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. The `MODEL_ENDPOINT` must point to a Hugging Face compatible API endpoint.

After downloading a model, use the CLI tools to run it locally - see below.

`llama.cpp` requires the model to be stored in the [GGUF](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md) file format. Models in other data formats can be converted to GGUF using the `convert_*.py` Python scripts in this repo.

The Hugging Face platform provides a variety of online tools for converting, quantizing and hosting models with `llama.cpp`:

- Use the [GGUF-my-repo space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo) to convert to GGUF format and quantize model weights to smaller sizes
- Use the [GGUF-my-LoRA space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-lora) to convert LoRA adapters to GGUF format (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10123)
- Use the [GGUF-editor space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CISCai/gguf-editor) to edit GGUF meta data in the browser (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/9268)
- Use the [Inference Endpoints](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) to directly host `llama.cpp` in the cloud (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/9669)

To learn more about model quantization, [read this documentation](tools/quantize/README.md)

#### Seminal papers and background on the models

If your issue is with model generation quality, then please at least scan the following links and papers to understand the limitations of LLaMA models. This is especially important when choosing an appropriate model size and appreciating both the significant and subtle differences between LLaMA models and ChatGPT:
- LLaMA:
    - [Introducing LLaMA: A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)
    - [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)
- GPT-3
    - [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
- GPT-3.5 / InstructGPT / ChatGPT:
    - [Aligning language models to follow instructions](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following)
    - [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)

## XCFramework
The XCFramework is a precompiled version of the library for iOS, visionOS, tvOS,
and macOS. It can be used in Swift projects without the need to compile the
library from source. For example:
```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.10
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyLlamaPackage",
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "MyLlamaPackage",
            dependencies: [
                "LlamaFramework"
            ]),
        .binaryTarget(
            name: "LlamaFramework",
            url: "https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/b5046/llama-b5046-xcframework.zip",
            checksum: "c19be78b5f00d8d29a25da41042cb7afa094cbf6280a225abe614b03b20029ab"
        )
    ]
)
```
The above example is using an intermediate build `b5046` of the library. This can be modified
to use a different version by changing the URL and checksum.

## Completions
Command-line completion is available for some environments.

#### Bash Completion
```bash
$ build/bin/llama-cli --completion-bash > ~/.llama-completion.bash
$ source ~/.llama-completion.bash
```
Optionally this can be added to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to load it
automatically. For example:
```console
$ echo "source ~/.llama-completion.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
